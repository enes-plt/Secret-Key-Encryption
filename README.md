# Secret-Key-Encryption
This project comprises multiple encryption-related tasks:

1.  Frequency Analysis: Decipher monoalphabetic substitution ciphers using letter frequency.
2.  Cipher Comparisons: Experiment with AES-128/256 in CBC and CFB modes using OpenSSL.
3.  Encryption Mode Comparisons: Encrypt images with ECB and CBC modes to study visual security differences.
4.  Padding: Investigate the effects of padding in block ciphers.
5.  Error Propagation: Examine how corruption in ciphertext impacts plaintext recovery in various modes.
6.  Initialization Vector (IV): Study the importance of unique and unpredictable IVs.
7.  Brute-Force Key Discovery: Use a dictionary attack to find a weak key in AES-128-CBC encryption.

The importance of secure key management and proper encryption practices in cryptography are being demonstrated.
